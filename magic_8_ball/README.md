# Magic 8 Ball

A "fortune telling" program written in various languages. It takes questions
from stdin and tries to answer them in a sensible manner. Upcoming versions will
read the exit codes and answer lists from a shared file.


# Running

If you have the appropriate interpreter or compiler installed, simply use the
command `./run lang`, where lang is the language/extension of the desired 
version [js|node|nodejs,lua,pl|perl,py|python,rb|ruby].
